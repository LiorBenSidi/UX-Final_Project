# UX - Final Project

As part of the "Human Factors Engineering" course, my partner and I analyzed and redesigned the SAP portal for submitting degree completion requests at the Technion(הגשת גמר תואר).

We applied a comprehensive Human-Centered Design approach — from field observations and detailed task analysis to prototyping using Figma and structured usability testing.

### User Research & Task Analysis
      - Conducted user observations with both novice and experienced students.
      - Performed detailed hierarchical and cognitive task analyses.
      - Identified UX issues, including unclear navigation, insufficient user feedback, and high cognitive load.

### UX/UI Design Solutions using Figma
      - We tackled three key usability problems:
         1. Unclear tab labels → Introduced clear, consistent naming and better hierarchy.
         2. Lack of feedback → Added immediate, clear feedback messages after key actions.
         3. Insufficient user guidance → Implemented dynamic, contextual hints.

### Structured Usability Testing
      - We tested our improved prototype using:
         1. Usability Test: Task completion scenarios measured by performance metrics (time, errors, clicks).
         2. Questionnaire: Post-task survey assessing user satisfaction and subjective feedback.

### Key Results:
      - ⏱️ Task time reduced by 18%.
      - 🖱️ Click count reduced by 19%.
      - ❌ Slight increase in errors for specific tasks.
      - 😊 User satisfaction remained unchanged (avg. 3.6/7).

### Insights & Next Steps
      - The redesign successfully improved navigation ease and efficiency in certain tasks but introduced
         complexity in others. Based on test results, we recommended:
         1. Strengthening visibility and impact of feedback messages.
         2. Adding undo functionality for critical actions.
         3. Providing short introductory guides for new users.
